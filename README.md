## Overview

This repository contains coursework and examples related to the "Database" course. It demonstrates how to design, implement, and query relational databases using SQL. It may include ER diagrams, relational schemas, normalization exercises, and query examples.

## Technologies

- **SQL** — for writing and running queries, creating tables, and managing data
- **Database Management Systems (DBMS)** — e.g. MySQL, PostgreSQL, SQLite (depending on your environment)
- **PDF/Reports** — documentation explaining the designs and exercises

## Repository Structure

A typical layout might look like:


Update this section to reflect your actual folder names.

## Key Features

- SQL scripts to create and populate tables
- Example queries demonstrating SELECT, JOIN, GROUP BY, and more
- Normalization exercises and relational schema design
- ER diagrams and relational models (if included)

## Getting Started

1. Clone the repository:
   ```bash
   git clone https://github.com/FrancescoFerrillo/Database.git
   cd Database
2. Open your preferred DBMS (MySQL, PostgreSQL, SQLite).

3. Run the SQL scripts to create the database and execute queries.

## Usage
Example to run a script in MySQL:
mysql -u username -p < ScriptSQL/create_tables.sql

Then you can execute queries like:
SELECT * FROM TableName;

Adjust these examples to match the actual file and table names in your repository.
